% Underwood Tenants Group

Founded by [Hasani Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNJRnupZ_G0)
and Thai Lee on November 1, 2023 in Omaha Nebraska.

**Our mission** is to inform tenants of their legal rights and to how to
hold slum landlords accountable for their negligence in treating poor living
conditions that are hazardous to the safety and wellbeing of the
tenant(s).

**We focus** on educating the tenant(s) on a process that will get them the
proper results. We teach our members the local, federal and state laws,
statutes, ordinances, and legislation that will get results if followed
properly. We try to give all our members an approach from the legal side
that will help them build confidence in their approach and in the
process.

We want all our members to be informed of their legal rights and how to
properly prepare a case to take into court. We are not the group that
focuses on teaching our members how to complain. We are the group
that build our members up and teach them how to stand up for
themselves legally when no one else would. Our passion is to motivate
and educate! We have to teach tenants how to be legally prepared
because no one is coming to save them.
